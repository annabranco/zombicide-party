_What party is a party without people shouting, shots being fired, police sirens ringing, motolovs exploding and... yeah, of course... lots zombies growls?
This app brings you all of this and much more to make your Zombicide parties rock and shine like never before._

## What is zombicide party?

This app allows help organizing all the logics and mechanics while playing Zombicide, and allow the players to reproduce activations and weapons sounds to create a rich and intense atmosphere and a more deep playing experience.

This is not a game by itself, but a tool make your gaming sessions more intense and organized.
You need a physical Zombicide tabletop game so this app can make any sense and be of any help for you.

## Game and Expansions

At this very moment, only Zombicide Season 1 is supported, as well as DogZ expansion and Karl Kopinski's characters.
You can also activate Night Shift Campaign Expansion. This is a custom campaign with exclusive material made by me and not supported by Guillotine Games. It is still under development, but you may take a peek and use some of its items ans features if you want to. Soon, Night Shift Campaign will be fully released.

## How to use it

You can just open the page <https://annabranco.github.io/zombicide-party/>. on any desktop computer, tablet or mobile devices and enjoy the experience. Note that the desktop version is the most recommended version to play it. If you are an experienced user or developer, you may clone this repo and run it with `yarn start`.
Note: even though you run it locally, you still need internet access to see part of the content.

## Future developments

It is planned for future developments to add more expansions and maybe 2nd Edition.
A server mnode is also planned, where players may have a server running and each player control its character by their own devices.
Any suggestions for future developments and enhancements are mostly welcome. Make sure to open an issue giving your suggestions and I could work on that. Just know that I develop all of this by myself on my free time and I receive absolutely nothing to do that, so please be kind and patient.
